# Discord-Bot
This is my discord bot, known as Bot Boi, the boi who is bot.


So it's not super complicated at the moment. It basically just uses the discord module to link(?) to the server on 
Discord that I created just to kinda fuck around on. The JSON files are completely unnessecary but I just wanted some practice
with that sort of data. One of them has my actual token or whatever, so anyone could really come and take control of my bot.
Maybe I should be worried, but if someone cares enough to hijack my bot it just means I'm finally famous.

What's the worst that could happen?
